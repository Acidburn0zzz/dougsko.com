h2. rspike: a ruby wrapper for the SPIKE fuzzing framework

Rspike will allow you to use the SPIKE fuzzing framework from your ruby
scripts.  The SPIKE framework is an extremely powerful tool used to discover
vulnerabilities in applications.

h3. what is a fuzzer?

According to Wikipedia, 

bq. "Fuzz testing, fuzzing, Robustness Testing or Negative
Testing is a software testing technique that provides random data ("fuzz") to
the inputs of a program. If the program fails (for example, by crashing, or by
failing built-in code assertions), the defects can be noted."

h3. about SPIKE

SPIKE is a very complete fuzzing API.  It's framework design makes it perfect
to test any protocol, regardless of whether or not it's stucture is actually
known.  Protocol definitions are stored in SPIKE files.  This separation of
fuzzing logic and the protocol definition makes it easy to re-use your fuzzing
code with many different protocols.  You can visit the SPIKE web page
"here":http://www.immunitysec.com/resources-freesoftware.shtml.

h3. tutorial

I'll eventually write up a tutorial for using this framework, but until
then, please refer to the examples provided in the source.

h3. download

You can check out the rspike git repository with this command:

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/dougsko/rspike.git
</pre>

Enjoy!
