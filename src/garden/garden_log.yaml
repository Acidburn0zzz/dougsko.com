    A second sprout appeared in pot A, right under the first one.  A sprout

  - |
    in pot B is just starting to poke out through the rockwool.  All the

  - |
    little sprouts in pot C are still growing well and getting bigger.

  - |
    The tallest sprout in pot A is 1/2", and the tallest sprout in pot C is 3/4"

    New sprouts popped up in pot A. Several sprouts emerged from pot B,

  - |
    being around 1" tall.  Sprouts in pot C are still doing well.

    Changed the water today.  The new solution is only half strength.  All

  - |
    plants have sprouted.

    I added a little more water to the solution so that it filled up all the

  - |
    way.  The parsely looks pretty bad, I think from planting too many too

  - |
    close to each other, but I think it's going to recover.  The flourescent

  - |
    lights I'm using are fairly useless.  The cilantro all fell over on

  - |
    itself, but seems to be doing pretty well despite that.
