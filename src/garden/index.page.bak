h2. growing herbs hydroponically

I decided I wanted to grow some fresh herbs in my kitchen, and to do
that, a small hydroponic garden would be the best choice.  

An Ebb and Flow system would be best for this sort of garden since it
would have a small footprint on my counter, require few parts, and could
easily be controlled with an X10 module and a cronjob.

The garden consists of two tupperware containers, one sitting on top of
the other.  The bottom container is the resevior, holding the nutrient
solution, and the top container holds the flower pots with the herbs in
them.
