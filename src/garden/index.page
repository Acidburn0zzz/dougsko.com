h3. growing herbs hydroponically

"Gallery RSS Feed":https://gallery.dougsko.com/main.php?g2_view=rss.SimpleRender&g2_itemId=618

I decided I wanted to grow some fresh herbs in my kitchen, and to do
that, a small hydroponic garden would be the best choice.  

An Ebb and Flow system would be best for this sort of garden since it
would have a small footprint on my counter, require few parts, and could
easily be controlled with an X10 module and a cronjob.

The garden consists of two tupperware containers, one sitting on top of
the other.  The bottom container is the reservoir, holding the nutrient
solution, and the top container holds the flower pots with the herbs in
them.  An aquarium pump sits inside the bottom container and when
switched on, it pumps the solution up into the top container, filling it
up.  The water cannot overflow because there is an emergency drain tube
in the top container preventing water from raising above it.  When the
pump turns off, the water drains back down into the reservoir.  The
black bag you see covering the bottom container is there to prevent
algae from growing in the nutrient solution.  I am using two 18"
flourecent grow lights mounted under the cabinets above the garden.
