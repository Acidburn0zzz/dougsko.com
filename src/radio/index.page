h2. web controlled ham radio

You can use the following page to listen to and control a Yaesu FT-847 ham
radio.  If you get a 500 error, the radio is either turned off or the server
script is not currently running.

This is all made possible by a thin ruby wrapper around "hamlib":http://hamlib.sourceforge.net.
You can check out the ruby code with the following command:

<pre>
 git clone git://github.com/dougsko/rham.git
</pre>

"radio control page":radio.rhtml
