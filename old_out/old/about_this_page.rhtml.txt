h2. how this page was made

This page was created by a script that creates a template containing eRuby.  The script also contains helper methods that the templates then use to display dynamic content.  Its only requirement is Red Cloth, which is available both as a Debian package, and as a Ruby Gem.  The only thing that needs to be changed in the script is the title of your site.

* "Red Cloth Website":http://whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/redcloth/
* *pfunk source:*  "pfunk.rb":pfunk.rb
* *pfunk documentation:* "rdoc":doc/
* *style sheet:*  "style.css":style.css

Every part of this page is licensed under the GPL.
